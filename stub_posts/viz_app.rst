Fun with Django and nvd3.js

Django documentation is great!

CSRF tokens cause a problems

Data cleaning "took longer than expected".

Still learning HTML. Used data because only need GET request, not post.

Unsure how to structure js code.

-nvd3.js is annoying because there is no / sparse documentation

tried using djangobower and django-nvd3 but django-nvd3.js also has not working examples and the CI tests were failing! So in both cases I decided just to use the underlying tool.
