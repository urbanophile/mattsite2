It makes the following assumptions about the
* equality of variances homoscedastic mean that there are
* independence of observations
* normality of residuals

* normality of residuals is equivalent to normality of the subgroups
* normality of residuals is important for the F-testing part of the ANOVA, not the model fitting part. We can fit the model just fine without residuals.
