One of the things that really excites me is how people make decisions. Sometimes it's gut feel, sometimes it's experience, and sometimes it's rational calculation, but it's always interesting.

I am perplexed by why people would ever buy lottery tickets. I know the excitment and thrill of anticipation for the hoped for outcome outweight cold calculation.

From a decision-theoretic point of view it's quite simple.
