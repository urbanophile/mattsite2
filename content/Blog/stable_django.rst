:summary: A brief riff on stable, mature tools


I've been playing around recently with a little project involving recommender systems. Anyway, for the website, I ended up reaching for Django. Man, it's been a while, but I forgot how joy it is to use it. The documentation is excellent. The platform is pretty stable and very mature. It's just lovely, usable technology, and I feel old saying this, but I value that more and more. In my PhD, I had some unpleasant experiences with a rapidly changing landscape for software in AI and ML, and it made me value stability a whole lot more. Another pleasant find was dokuwiki which has been a breeze to setup and use. 

Also, book data is much messier than I ever would have thought, and this is from someone who loves books (and data)!
