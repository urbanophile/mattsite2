Computer graphics is full of wizardry but the demo scene is populated by arch-wizards. The community has some `very talented people <https://www.shadertoy.com/user/iq>`_ and there's lots to learn (`like ray marching and signed distance functions <https://jamie-wong.com/2016/07/15/ray-marching-signed-distance-functions/>`_).  I tried my hand at a couple of dweets, which are tiny demos that fit in a tweet.

This was from just playing around with the default dweet. It reminds me a bit of view of sky traffic in movies like Blade Runner or the Fifth Element, and I'd like to come back to it.

I'm more proud this, which does a simple display of the `Peter de Jong Attractors <https://paulbourke.net/fractals/peterdejong/>`_ as well as a couple of dwitter tricks including `unicode packing <https://xem.github.io/codegolf/obfuscatweet.html>`_. This one reminds me of smoke monster from Lost.

There's some very talented people there, I recommend having a look at 

- Frank Force  (`dwitter <https://www.dwitter.net/u/KilledByAPixel>`__  `personal <https://frankforce.com/javascript-2/>`_)
- Tom Reznik `dwitter <https://www.dwitter.net/u/tomxor>`__
