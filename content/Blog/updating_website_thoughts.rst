It's been a little while since I've updated my website.

Good:

* Pelican 👍: having software after not having used it for years is a welcome surprise. Especially given that I migrated from Python 2 to Python 3.
* static site generation 👍: Still handy. Handles a bunch of stuff website bureaucracy and whatnot I'd rather not be bothered with. 

Bad:

* random css 👎: I don't have a great sense of aesthetics so I've typically relied on someone elses'. In practice, that means copying other people's designs and CSS. That CSS, however, has aged poorly.
* using git submodules 👎: my setup for deploying this site was convoluted
* rst 👎: sorry,like mercurial ReStructured text just hasn't had community adoption.
* cli-only 👎: I would probably update my website more if it was easier. This was not helped by keeping content in a separate repo
