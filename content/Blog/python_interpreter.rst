I enjoyed this talk introduction by `Allison Kaptur <https://akaptur.com/>`_ - "Bytes in the Machine" which provides easy but insightful introduction to the CPython intepreter. Worth watching if you'd like to know more about how CPython is implemented and what exactly the interpreter is doing.

Could be followed up with `this intro by Guido <https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Yet-another-guided-tour-of-CPython-XY7KgFGn88zMNivGJ4Jzv/>`_ or a `very long tour through the CPython interpreter <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzV58Zm8FuBL6OAv1Yu6AwXZrnsFbbR0S>`_ by Prof Philip Guo, which I've started watching. It's nice to get a better understand of the tools you use everyday, and it makes me very curious about the structure of the other Python implementations: `Link PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`_, `Link Jython <http://www.jython.org/>`_, `Link tinypy <http://www.tinypy.org/>`_, `Link Skulpt <http://www.skulpt.org/>`_, etc.
