I enjoyed this quick introduction to the CPython intepreter. Worth watching if you'd like to know more about how CPython is implemented and what exactly the interpreter is doing.

Could be followed up with `Link this dive <http://pgbovine.net/cpython-internals.htm/>`_ through the CPython intepreter by Prof Philip Guo, which I've started watching. It's nice to get a better understand of the tools you use everyday, and it makes me very curious about the structure of the other Python implementations: `Link PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`_, `Link Jython <http://www.jython.org/>`_, `Link tinypy <http://www.tinypy.org/>`_, `Link Skulpt <http://www.skulpt.org/>`_, etc.
