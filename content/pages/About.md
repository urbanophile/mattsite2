I am a software and machine learning developer in [Sydney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney), NSW, Australia. I like [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502), [data](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/vcd/html/HorseKicks.html), [machine learning](https://pytorch.org/) and [cooking](https://web.archive.org/web/20160210065535/http://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab/?ref=nav_main). I'm delighted by the scientific enterprise which allows us ["to see a World in a Grain of Sand"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43650/auguries-of-innocence). 

I'm also quite keen on gibbons üêí.

I acknowledge and pay my respects to the Traditional Custodians of the land on which I work and live, and their elders past, present, and emerging. Sovereignty was never ceded.
