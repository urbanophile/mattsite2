I am a machine learning engineer living in `Sydney <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney>`_, 'Straya. I like  `computing <http://www.python.org/>`_, `data analysis <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/>`_ , `statistical machine learning <http://www.r-project.org/>`_ and `cooking <http://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab/?ref=nav_main>`_. I'm delighted by the scientific enterprise which allows us "to see a World in a Grain of Sand". 


I'm also quite keen on gibbons 🐒.
