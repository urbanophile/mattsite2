I am a data scientist living in `Sydney <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney>`_, 'Straya. I like  `computing <http://www.python.org/>`_, `data analysis <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/>`_ , `statistical <http://www.r-project.org/>`_ and `cooking <http://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab/?ref=nav_main>`_. I'm fascinated by decision making and social choice (such as `voting <http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/>`_).

I'm also quite keen on gibbons.

This second version of my homepage is served off github.io pages using Pelican.
