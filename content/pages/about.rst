I am a software developer in `Sydney <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney>`_, NSW, Australia. I like  `computing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502>`_, `data <https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/vcd/html/HorseKicks.html>`_ , `machine learning <https://pytorch.org/>`_ and `cooking <https://web.archive.org/web/20160210065535/http://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab/?ref=nav_main>`_. I'm delighted by the scientific enterprise which allows us "to see a World in a Grain of Sand". 


I'm also quite keen on gibbons 🐒.

I acknowledge and pay my respects to the Traditional Custodians of the land on which I work and live, and their elders past, present, and emerging. Sovereignty was never ceded.
